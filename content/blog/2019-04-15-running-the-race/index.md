When you run 100m dash you have to go all out. The fastest runner wins.

When you run 400m sprint you give your all. Around 300m your legs are full of lactic acid and you are not entirely sure how those bricks are getting off the ground. You embrace the pain. The runner that can maintain the pace at the increasing rate of pain wins.

When you are out to win 1500m race you need to be smart. You need to know yourself and your competition. You need to have strategy and understand the game of intimidation. You still need to run fast, you will still have to endure pain, but now you need to plan and adjust depending on the day, your state and your competition.

As you take on longer distances knowing yourself matters more, planning matters more.

I ran the 100m dash every month when I was self-employed. Every month, every project, every client was the 100m dash.

At the startup that hired me upon graduation, the team ran a 400m race. There was speed and there was pain.

Jostle however is a different kind of athlete. An athlete that embraced a long game. A conservative, but very aware of its strengths. An athlete that continuously self evaluates. Focused on making the team stronger and more integrated. And addressing the clients immediate needs with flexible features to fit a wider range of use cases.

Last week Jostle held its first JostleFest. It is the first quarterly event to celebrate achievements and work across the entire organization.

Development teams demoed latest features and presented Q2 plans. Marketing team shared approaches used to get products in front of potential customers. Sales and customer success teams brought to the table customers and prospects point of view how to further improve project.

Everyone left more engaged and aware of how their work contribute to the success. Sales and customer success are now more comfortable talking about the future of the product and development team is more in tune with customer needs.

Maturing as an athlete is not only a process of growing extra muscles and logging extra miles. Lots of work has to be done to understand the self, build confidence, habits and mindset.

Itâ€™s easy to expect that doubling in size as an organization will result in doubling in productivity. That is never the case. There is a period of time where a team needs to learn to communicate, understand the system and see the long term vision. Give it time.

Gather strengths and lean into the experience.
