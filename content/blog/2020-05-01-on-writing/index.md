> “Nonfiction writing should alway have a point: it should leave the reader with a set of facts, or an idea, or a point of view, that he didn’t have before he started reading. Writers may write for any number of good personal reasons — ego, therapy, recollection, validation of their lives. But what they produce will have a validity of its own to the extent that it’s useful for somebody else.” 
[William Zinsser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Zinsser).

I think about writing a lot.

I also write a lot. I write for “a number of good personal reasons”. I write to clear my mind. I write to understand what has been said or done. I write to ask and answer questions. I write to clarify an idea, to workout my own thoughts. I write to focus.

I like writing. I like how my hand dictates the pace of my thoughts. I love reading what I wrote as if I am a distant someone telling me a story. I like working on my sentences, editing words, reworking structure to bring more clarity and better flow.

At work we are writing much more during these days of remote work. Written communication is even more vital than it has ever been before. While in person certain concepts could be explained faster, now we spend more time putting ourselves in other people’s shoes and read through their eyes to make sure anyone can easily understand what was said.

I love studying writing. I stop to examine easy to understand text. I ponder over words & sentences. I love reading books and articles about writing methods. I love learning about the process that other writers take to create. In high school I aspired to one day write a book. I do not know if there’s anything better than to have a skill to tell a story, explain an idea or inspire another human by drawing a picture and illuminating imagination with words.

As excited as I get about writing I have fear to share my writing with others. I fear to be exposed, misunderstood, misread. Writing is personal, writing makes one vulnerable.

To share my writing also means that a reader will choose to spend their time reading my work over spending time on something else, potentially something more useful.

I write for my ego, my therapy, validation of my life and work. I fear that the piece of writing that I produce is not useful for anyone else.

However, motivated by the courage of my co-worker to share his learnings, I will embrace my fear. I hope that some of my writings will be of help to some of the people, as some people’s works are a source of learning and influence to me.
