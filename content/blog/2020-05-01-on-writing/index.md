> “Nonfiction writing should alway have a point: it should leave the reader with a set of facts, or an idea, or a point of view, that he didn’t have before he started reading. Writers may write for any number of good personal reasons — ego, therapy, recollection, validation of their lives. But what they produce will have a validity of its own to the extent that it’s useful for somebody else.” 
[William Zinsser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Zinsser).

I write for “a number of personal reasons”. I write for my ego, my therapy, validation of my life and work. I write to clear my mind. I write to understand what has been said. I write to ask a question. I write to clarify an idea and to workout my own thoughts.

I like how my hand dictates the pace of my thoughts. I love reading what I wrote as if I am a distant someone telling me a story. I like working on my sentences. Editing words. Reworking structure to bring more clarity and better flow.

I write to kick-off, unblock and close projects.

Blank sheet of paper, empty editor screen is the starting line of every opportunity.
