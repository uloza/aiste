Last night I attended Mentorship 101 workshop. It was 2.5 hours of interactive reflection and discussion time. 95% of attendees were woman as the workshop was organized and presented by Women Who Code in cooperation with Lighthouse Labs. 

Here’s just some thoughts floating in my head after it.

Family members as mentors
It was interesting to see how many woman came forward to claim their family members (partners, mothers, fathers, etc.) as their closest mentors. People that know them best, share similar values and have insight into the industries as they are already working in it.

I can vouch for that, as my dad was the guiding star in my career change. As a programmer for the past 30 plus years, he shared his work, spent time learning new things with me, taught me basic principles, and talked about his views and experiences in the industry.

Know what you want
So many of us, at least in the beginning, want someone to tell us what to do — what to learn, where to focus, how to get better at the craft. Drop your expectations, that’s not gonna happen. Nobody wants to be responsible for your life. You need to figure out on your own, what are your doubts, weaknesses and what questions do you need answered. What do you want to walk out from the mentor-mentee interaction with?

Everyone was a beginner once
Truth. And that memory is not gonna go anywhere. Everyone started knowing nothing, and then learned it. So will you. Count on people being willing to help. Count on their memory of what a struggle it was and how “painful” it may have been to ask for help.

Be kind and respectful with their time. Have a question and remember to follow up with progress. It is in human nature to enjoy feeling important and appreciated.

Woman in male dominated industries
I have been working in tech on and off for over 20 years now. And as much as I was lucky enough to work with male counterparts that were respectful, inclusive, supportive and helpful, I always struggled with self confidence. What if what I am saying is obvious, what if everyone already thought about it, what if this is a stupid idea, what if my opinion doesn’t matter, what if I will look stupid… List goes on.

Well. To that I have to say this —work on yourself. It’s a work in progress for me and I will share more on this topic later, but having a mentor that went through similar experiences, the one that you can bounce your ideas of before presenting it to the team is a very valuable. Plus more often then not it is worth raising a question even if it may seem obvious.

After last night I realize that I probably have more life experience to share than I thought. I realized how little it takes to help others feel better. I am looking for someone to guide me through career and professional development, someone to give me feedback on my project work, but I am here to everyone who is starting out as a developer and is in need of some guidance, reassurance or help.
