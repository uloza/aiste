*[Inspired by How to grow Junior Developer published on June 6, 2017](https://medium.com/human-business-project/how-to-grow-junior-developer-3a4b0dab057b)*

This is an account of what helped me and what I try to teach and apply with *junior* developers joining my team. 

##### Seek to understand
Urge to deliver is the worst enemy of growing developers.
Take time to understand the problem, the context and the system.
If you cannot explain why your solution works - you are not ready to contribute your code to production.

Most of the systems are built as an improvement of another system. Understanding one will give you a headstart to understanding another one.

##### Read documentation
Urge to deliver is the worst enemy of growing developers.
You have time to read through documentation. You do not need to memorize it, you need to know what it can do, what limitations and quirks language, framework, library have and where to search for information. 

Especially when seeking to understand - what inputs method takes, what return values to expect, what changes properties introduce.

StackOverflow is there when you cannot find answers in the documentation.

##### Demonstrate your thought process
Explain your solution to your manager, coding buddy or a person that will do your code review. That way you will uncover if there is data missing, or concepts that are misunderstood. It is a chance to practice engineering and organization's cultural vocabulary. It will demonstrate your growing knowledge and expanding understanding. 

It can be done in person or in writing, whatever appeals to you better, but do it, it is a part of the job.
